/**
 * Directive controllers are used in AngularJS for inter-directive communication, while link functions are fully contained and specific to the directive instance.
 * By interdirective communication, we mean when one directive on an element wants to communicate with another directive on its parent or on the same element. 
 * This encompasses sharing state or variables, or even functions.
 * 
 * Whenever we need to communicate between child and parent directives, or between sibling directives, we should consider using directive controllers.
 * The controller can define functions that are specific to the directive instance by defining them on $scope and define the API or accessible functions and variables
 * by defining them on this or the controllerâ€™s instance.
