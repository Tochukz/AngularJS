/* Here a some important point in the directive defintion object:
 * transclude: 'element', //Capture and replace the entire element instead of just its content
 * A $transclude is passed in as the fifth argument to the link function. 
 * $trasnclude in a function that allows us to create new instances of our template as many times as needed depending on our use case. The function takes an 
 * optional scope (if a new scope is needed for the element; otherwise, it inherits the directiveâ€™s scope) and a mandatory clone linking function as the second argument.
 * We create a new child scope i.e $scope.$new(). This is so that any modification made to the scope does not get reflected in the parent scope. This is always a good practice 
 * to make sure no global states step on each other.
