/*
* Resolves are a way of executing and finishing asynchronous tasks before a particular route is loaded. This is a great way to check if the user is
* logged in and has authorization and permissions, and even preload some data before a controller and route are loaded into the view.
* 
* Note that the two keys: 'immediate' and 'async', of the resolve object are of our own choosing. They could be 'myKey1' and 'myKey2'.  
*
* If there are multiple resolve keys that make asynchronous calls, AngularJS executes all of them in parallel and waits for all of them to finish executing 
* before loading the page.
*
* If any of the resolves encounter an error or any of the promises returned are rejected(is a failure), AngularJS doesnâ€™t load the route.
*
* Test this by running the inbuilt PHP server:
* $ php -S 127.0.0.1:9000 -t AngularJS-Up-and-Running
* then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:9000/chp10/chp10b.html on the browser address bar.
