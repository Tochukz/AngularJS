<!--
 Note that the pickMe function is passed an object literal whose key is exactly the same as the string passed to the onItemSelect  method in index.html
 The onItemSelect method is defined on the parent scope( in the MainCtrl) and passed to the directive using the on-select attribute.
 The on-select attribute value is mapped(as a function) to the pickMe key using the scope object i.e 
     scope: {
         pickMe: '&onSelect'
     }
